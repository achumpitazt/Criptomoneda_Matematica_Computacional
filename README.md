# Criptomoneda_Matematica_Computacional
Ok, maybe the "Cryptocurrency" is not the correct word that i'll describe this project.
This project was develop with the objetive to use sum probabilities basic algorithm.
For example: You are the owner of a "cryptocurrency Wallet" and you want to invert on sponsors or other topic to rise his value. 
If you invert your crypto will have a higher value. 
This is a "simulation" using C# and a local SQLServer path.
